            Kai, once Master Oogway’s closest friend, fell into darkness and
            became obsessed with stealing chi. After centuries trapped in the
            Spirit Realm, he has returned, wielding jade warriors and seeking
            ultimate power by draining the energy of every kung fu master.

            tried to change his destiny by wiping out pandas, only to be stopped
            by Po, the very panda he feared.

            into a fearsome villain. With unmatched strength and skill, he
            challenged the Valley of Peace, only to meet his fate at the paws of
            Po.
